# CIA-Login-Prank
This is a web based fake CIA Login form written with CSS, HTML, and JS. Made as a prank for friends, family, etc.

To open the fake login page navigate to `\CIA-Login-Prank\login-page\` and open the the `login.html` file. I suggest you press `F11` to make it fullscreen for the most convincing look.

The login looks best on a 1920x1080 display in fullscreen (`F11`).

**Defualt Agent ID and Agent Password:**
Agent ID: `agent1234`
Agent Password: `password1234`

*To edit the login credentials change the variables `userAgentId` and `userAgentPassword` in `\CIA-Login-Prank\login-page\loginCheck.js`. By default they are set to `agent1234` and `password1234`.*
